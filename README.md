mockito-eclipse-tools
=====================

Eclipse plugin that simplifies test creation by providing refactorings for Mockito mocks.

It enables to:
1. Introduce a @Mock field from non-existing variable declaration
2. Introduce mock local variable from non-existing variable declaration
3. Adds @RunsWith(MockitoJunitRunner.class) when needed

TBD.
